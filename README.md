# P2P-File-Sharing-System-Project-

A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing system is a decentralized network model that allows users (peers) to share files directly with one another without relying on a central server. Instead of retrieving data from a single location, every participant both provides and receives data, making the network more scalable and resilient.

ðŸ”§ Key Features

Decentralization: No central authority controls the networkâ€”users interact directly.

File Distribution: Large files are split into smaller chunks and distributed across peers, then reassembled during download.

Resource Sharing: Each peer contributes bandwidth and storage, creating a collaborative ecosystem.

Fault Tolerance: The system remains operational even if several peers disconnect, thanks to multiple sources for each file.
